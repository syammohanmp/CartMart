Cart Mart
-----------------

Cart Mart will convert your Magento Store to Multivendor Marketplace, which will have a separate vendor / seller section for their Products. It also has inbuilt reviews and feedback system.

Cart Mart was the result of a fork of Openwriter_Cartmart on Oct 07, 2014. At that time, the Openwriter_Cartmart was a free opensource extension.
